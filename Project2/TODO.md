- Append and prepend and handle different length grids in a less stupid way
- Restructure into classes like with the other implemented methods.
- Compare speed between sparse solve and scipy.linalg.solve_banded
- Importing function from file in parent directory is [impossible in python apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16780014/import-file-from-parent-directory)
- Pretty plots
- Task1 numerical errors earlier than expected, maybe normal, didn't think about it

- Task 1.2 largest deflection -1.1741059085875696e-06 Looks reasonable
